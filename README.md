# EmergencyStash
Store your crypto in password-protected stashs!

## Why?
Let's say shit hit the fan real hard, and you lose everything. (including your wallet, seed phase, etc.) e.g. let's say you have to flee the country after you piss someone a bit too powerful off. It might be good to have some unstoppable emergency fund that you can easily reclaim. unless you can remember your seed phase. (I dont')

## EmergencyStash
I might be too paranoid, but here we are. EmergencyStash is practically a password-protected vault. you can reclaim this vault as long as you know the password. (hopefully, you still remember it) the vault implements commit reveal + time delay to prevent front running. so yeah, this should be good enough to store some emergency funds?
### note: this is like a 3 AM random idea. And secure by my autopilot security practice. pls proceed with caution
