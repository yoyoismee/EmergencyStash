# EmergencyStash
store your crypto in password protected stash!

### why ?
Let's say shit hit the fan real hard and you loss everything. (including you wallet, seedphase, etc) 
e.g. let's say you have to flee the country after you piss someone a bit too powerful off. 
I think it might be good to have some unstopable emergency fund that you can easily reclaim.
btw - if you can remember you seedphase. that good for ya. lol

### EmergencyStash
I might be too paranoided but here we are. EmergencyStash practically a password protected vault.
you can reclaim this vault as long as you know the password. (hopefully you still remember it)
the vault implement commit reveal + time delay to prevent front running.
so yeah this should be good enough to store some emergency fund? 

### note: this is like 3 AM random idea. and secure by my auto pilot security practice. pls proceed with caution
